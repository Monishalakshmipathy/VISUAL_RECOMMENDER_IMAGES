# Git Visual Recommender System: Fashion Image Recommendation Using Deep Learning

## Overview

The Visual Recommender System leverages deep learning techniques to recommend fashion images based on user preferences. This project uses the **Kaggle Fashion Dataset**, a collection of clothing images, to compare the performance of two powerful deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The novelty of this project lies in the comparative analysis of these two models, evaluating their effectiveness in image recommendation tasks.

## Features

- **Fashion Image Classification**: The system can recommend fashion images based on user input.
- **Model Comparison**: The project compares the performance and accuracy of CNN and RNN models for fashion image recommendations.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes CNN and RNN architectures for extracting visual features and generating recommendations.

## Dataset

This project uses the **Kaggle Fashion Dataset**, which consists of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories (e.g., T-shirts, dresses, shoes). The dataset is publicly available and used for training, testing, and evaluating the models.

## Models

1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
   - CNN is used for extracting spatial features from fashion images and classifying them based on visual patterns.
   
2. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):
   - RNN is implemented to understand temporal dependencies and sequential data, applied here to model fashion images in sequence and compare its accuracy with CNN.

## Project Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - The fashion dataset is loaded, preprocessed, and split into training and testing sets.
   
2. Model Training:
   - Both CNN and RNN models are trained on the preprocessed data.
   
3. Model Evaluation:
   - The performance of both models is evaluated by comparing their accuracy on the testing dataset.
   
4. Recommendation System:
   - Based on the trained models, the recommender system suggests similar fashion images.
